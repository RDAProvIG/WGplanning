    - <http://andrew.treloar.net/>
    - Stay tuned after TAB elections
- Concrete working group tasks
    - Gather use cases,
    - link them, and
    - identify them as provenance scenarios
- Attention to technology state of the art?
    - block chains, e.g.?
    - beyond our scope?
    - too uncertain in general, but maybe specific opportunities.
- Important to capture use cases, even where we can't make recommendations.
- Certainly could refer to specific technologies in recommendations.
    - Good example of IG/WG role distinction: tech maturity.
- Broaden audeince conception of different kinds of provenance in different roles.
    - "provenance views"
    - Consider, e.g., IP constraints on views.
- Tools as  opportunities for research/adoption role clarification
- Review, testing, and recommendation of tools?
- Alignment at a more general level than other working groups.
- N.b. Breakout slides on interest group page.
- How specific will the WG/IGs want to get?
    - our pref: more specific.
    - face up to resource limitation.
    - e.g., mapping does not necessarily require a triple store.

## Highlights from the TAB chairs meeting

- TAB interested in groups meeting the needs of other groups.
- Goups seem eager for best rpactive recommendations.
- Marine Data Harmonization IG: consider identifying audience for our
  communications.
    - in particular, different roles, and different degrees of
      technical sophistication.
- Biodiversity data group's specific interest in our outputs?
- Are testbeds the next step?

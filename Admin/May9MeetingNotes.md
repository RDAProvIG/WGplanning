## Notes from the RDA Provenance Patterns WG Meeting, May 9, 2017, 1:00 AM UTC.

Participants: Anusuriya Devaraju, Dave Dubin, Jens Klump, Steve
McEachern, Mingfang Wu, Lesley Wyborn.

Dave Dubin presented three approaches to representing agent roles in
provenance descriptions, relating these to a use case that emerged
from the RDA/TDWG Metadata Standards for Attribution of Physical and
Digital Collections Stewardship WG session at RDA P9 in Barcelona.

The first example is consistent with an understanding of roles as unique
particulars that are realized by events and inhere in the agent. The second
example models the role as a property of the association obtaining between the
agent and the event. The third example models the role as a property contingently
instantiated by the agent, in virtue of her participation in the event.

The next steps for developing these examples will include demonstrations of mapping
descriptions from one to the other. It was suggested during discussion that the
agent relationship roles (as in the W3 ORG ontology) could also be related to
these examples.

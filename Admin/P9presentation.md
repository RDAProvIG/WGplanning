# Some discussions this week

1. The Scholarly Link Exchange Working Group
    - Scholix: an evolving lightweight set of guidelines for
      exchanging information about the links between scholarly
      literature and data.
    - Most of the discussions on Wednesday were sense making exercises:
         - Why only publications and data sets?
	 - Hub model: why is a bridging service needed?
	 - What level of research data description is appropriate for a bibliographic record?
	 - Will/can/should Scholix offer some of the services on my wish list?
2. BoF on incentivizing work toward making data and samples available for sharing.
    - Beyond the *h*-index: contextual indicators for collaborations, etc.
    - CoBRA guidelines for the citation of bioresources in scientific journal articles.
3. TDWG/RDA WG on Metadata standards for collection stewardship attribution
    - OpenRIF/VIVO-ISF Ontology: Contributor roles, activities, and relationships in clinical research
    - CRediT (Contributor Roles Taxonomy) represents the diverse roles of contributors to scientific scholarly output.
    - The taxonomy supports multiple contributors for the same roles, with basic measures of degree of contribution.
4. IG Data Versioning constitutive meeting
    - Data Citation of Evolving Data: Recommendations of the Working Group on Data Citation (WGDC)
    - The WGDC recommendations enable researchers and data centers to
      identify and cite data used in experiments and studies. Instead
      of providing static data exports or textual descriptions of data
      subsets, we support a dynamic, query centric view of data sets.

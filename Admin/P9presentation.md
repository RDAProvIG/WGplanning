# Some discussions this week

1. The Scholarly Link Exchange Working Group
    - Scholix: an evolving lightweight set of guidelines for
      exchanging information about the links between scholarly
      literature and data.
    - Most of the discussions on Wednesday were sense making exercises:
         - Why only publications and data sets?
	 - Why is a bridging service needed?
	 - What level of research data description is appropriate for a bibliographic record?
	 - Will/can/should Scholix offer some of the services on my wish list?

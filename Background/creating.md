# Creating a Working Group

From <https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/creating-and-managing-rda-groups/creating-or-joining-rda-working-group.html>

Working Groups (WGs) require more commitment than Interest
Groups. Working Groups develop Case Statements that are then reviewed
by the RDA Community, Technical Advisory Board (TAB), and
Council. Review criteria include:

- Fit with the overall RDA vision and mission
- International membership spanning, ideally, three or more continents
- 2-4 co-chairs leading the initiative
- Measurable outcomes
- Outcomes will foster data sharing and/or exchange, and be taken up
  by the intended community
- Proposed work, outcomes /deliverables, and Action Plan described in
  the Case Statement can be accomplished in 12-18 months
- Appropriate scope of the WG
- The effort adds value over and above what is currently being done
  within the community.

# Working Group Expectations and Case Statements

(from <https://www.rd-alliance.org/working-and-interest-groups/case-statements.html>)

## RDA Working Group Expectations

Working Groups are expected to:

- Develop clear outcomes and put them into action to create tangible
  progress (see also Working Group Goals and Outcomes and the RDA
  Outputs and Intellectual Property Policy).
- Work openly and transparently with respect to the community.
- Document their efforts as they operate.
- Meet regularly with the RDA to facilitate coordination and
  communication.

RDA WG members are expected to commit their time and effort to making
the WG successful, and should intend to carry out the “action plan” of
the WG within their home organization/institution/group to the best of
their abilities. Each recognized RDA WG should include adopters for
the stated outcomes and deliverables, and members who can make
substantial impact through efforts within their home organization,
institution, or group. RDA working group constituencies should be
international and multi-sector.

With approval of a Case Statement by the RDA Council, a recognized RDA
Working Group is formed. The RDA Secretariat and TAB will work closely
with the WG during its operation to facilitate progress and
communications and to coordinate with other WGs and RDA bodies.

WGs are expected to operate transparently and utilize the RDA website
and online interaction channels to engage the community and keep the
community informed of their efforts. Intermediate and final
deliverables/outcomes should be made available to the community
through the RDA website.

The WG should plan for dissemination and communication about WG
action, results, and outcomes, and to keep the community informed on
WG progress. Other vehicles for communication and public and community
engagement (including published work, news releases, etc.) may also be
appropriate. The Secretariat can assist with communications.

As WG efforts complete, the WG Chairs will inform RDA of relevant
outcomes and how they will be sustained. Recommendations will undergo
a formal RDA review process as outlined in the Group Process and
Procedures document. The group will also provide a record of relevant
notes, minutes, and materials from the WG for archiving by the
RDA. Working Groups should also report out at all plenary meetings
that occur during their period of activity.

## Working Groups: Case Statements

In order to be considered by the RDA Council as a recognized RDA
Working Group, groups should prepare a Case Statement to be assessed
by the community, the Technical Advisory Board (TAB), and RDA
Council. Please contact enquiries [at] rd-alliance.org if you want to
submit a Case Statement.

A Case Statement describes:

1. What is the research case (will the WG produce something useful)?
2. What is the business case (will people use it)?
3. Is there capacity (are the right people involved to adopt and
   implement).  Case Statement Content

 A Case Statement must contain the following components:

1. WG Charter: A concise articulation of what issues the WG will
   address within a 12-18 month time frame and what its “deliverables”
   or outcomes will be.
2. Value Proposition: A specific description of who will benefit from
   the adoption or implementation of the WG outcomes and what tangible
   impacts should result.
3. Engagement with existing work in the area: A brief review of
   related work and plan for engagement with any other activities in
   the area.
4. Work Plan: A specific and detailed description of how the WG will
   operate including:
    - Adoption Plan: A specific plan for adoption or implementation of
      the WG outcomes within the organizations and institutions
      represented by WG members, as well as plans for adoption more
      broadly within the community. Such adoption or implementation
      should start within the 12-18 month timeframe before the WG is
      complete.
    - The form and description of final deliverables of the WG, 
    - The form and description of milestones and intermediate
      documents, code or other deliverables that will be developed
      during the course of the WG’s work,
    - A description of the WG’s mode and frequency of operation
      (e.g. on-line and/or on-site, how frequently will the group
      meet, etc.),
    - A description of how the WG plans to develop consensus, address
      conflicts, stay on track and within scope, and move forward
      during operation, and
    - A description of the WG’s planned approach to broader community
      engagement and participation.
6. Initial Membership: A specific list of initial members of the WG
   and a description of initial leadership of the WG.

The WG should be organized as specified in the Case Statement. It is
expected that there will be either a Chair and a Vice-Chair, or 2-4
co-Chairs, who will lead the group and be responsible for
communication within the RDA and more broadly.

The WG Chairs will take primary responsibility for the quality, scope,
timeliness, and usefulness of the work in progress. The Chairs will
ensure that there is an effective organizational structure in place
for the WG and that there are individuals, groups, and processes that
can ensure progress in infrastructure and tool development, the
development and editing of policy and written documents, and other
tangible outcomes.

The responsibilities of the WG Chairs, other leaders and members
should be described in the WG Case Statement, and followed during
operation of the Group.

## Case Statement Review Criteria

Each submitted Candidate Working Group (CWG) Case Statement will be
made available for input from the RDA community. This input and the
submitted Case Statement will be forward for consideration to the RDA
Council.

WGs should deliver specific, concrete, and needed outcomes that help
researchers and related communities share and exchange data. Many
mechanisms exist for developing high-level studies, recommendations,
and guidance. Where RDA seeks to add value is by demonstrating the
data exchange and implementing the actual tools and mechanisms called
for by these studies and that truly meet community needs. Efforts that
would lead to papers, recommendations, etc. are meant to complement
rather than serve as deliverables of RDA Working Groups.

Council seeks to ensure that the efforts of the groups are well
aligned with the RDA mission and principles. For Working Groups,
Council will consult with the TAB on the content of the Case Statement
and assess the level of community consensus that emerged during the
creation and discussion of the Case Statement.

Each CWG Case Statement will be evaluated (by the community, TAB, and
Council) based on the following criteria:

Focus:

- Are there measurable outcomes?

Impact and Engagement:

- Will the outcome(s) of the Working Group be taken up by the intended
  community?
- Will the outcome(s) of the Working Group foster data sharing and/or
  exchange?

Timeframe:

- Can the proposed work, outcomes /deliverables, and Action Plan
  described in the Case Statement be accomplished in 12-18 months?

Scope/Fit:

- Is the scope too large for effective progress, too small for an RDA
  effort, or not appropriate for the RDA?
- Overall, is this a worthwhile effort for the RDA to take on? Is this
  an effort that adds value over and above what is currently being
  done within the community?

In assessing these criteria, Council will consider whether the Case
Statement addresses the following questions. These are all questions
of impact, rather than technical merit.

1. What is the evidence that the research community wants this?
    - The specific research communities who will benefit are <WHO?>
      and that benefit is <WHAT?>.
    - Specific benefits of the work that connect distinct communities
      are <WHAT?>.
    - This will enable the specific researchers to address <WHAT
      RESEARCH ISSUE?> more easily.
    - Comment: Adopters and beneficiaries of the deliverables must be
      represented in the Working Group to demonstrate research
      community demand and drive its impact.
2. What are the practical outcomes?
    - In the course of this work, <WHAT?> will be adopted by the <WHO
      from 1a?>.  (This provides evidence that demonstrates that the
      deliverables are useful.)
    - Comment: Deliverables are expected to be implemented code,
      adopted policy or practice, implemented infrastructure or tools,
      etc.
    - Comment: Deliverables are expected to directly benefit the
      research community during the course of the working group.
    - Comment: Reports and recommendations alone are not aligned with
      the notion of RDA deliverable.
3. How do the deliverables make it easier for researchers to do their
   work?  What significant changes will be made in how research is
   undertaken?
    - The deliverables will make it easier for research communities to
      do their work <HOW?> and <TO WHAT BENEFIT?>.
    - What barriers to data sharing or exchange are being removed and how?
    - Could the deliverables disrupt current practice?
4. Who will implement or adopt the deliverable, and are the adopters
   and beneficiaries included in the Working Group?
    - Who are the adopters?
    - Who are the beneficiaries?
    - How are they included in the Working Group and what are their roles?
    - What is the Working Group’s strategy for broader adoption?
5. What is the schedule for implementation or adoption of the
   deliverables during the course of the Working Group?
    - Comment: Milestones should reference groups and deliverables
      from questions 1 and 2.
6. What are the advantages of the proposed approach compared to
   existing approaches?
    - What else is being done now?
    - Why is the adoption of the proposed deliverables an improvement?
    - What are the impediments to global adoption?

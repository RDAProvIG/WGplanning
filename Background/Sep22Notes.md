# Adoption
Identify the 3 or 4 key ig/wg
- TDWG et al
Start with them, ste an example, see who else wants to work with us.
- Plausible scenario for recognition and acceptance
- GA: demonstration of pattern adoption.
  - can we cite one example (legacy document metadata pattern adoption)
  - connecting provenance graphs to doocument metadata 
  - ISO19115-1:2014 GA profile -- comming!

- Laying out our expectations for how we'll present and elicit responses to stakeholders
- what does a best practice document look like
- key issue: audience that's receptive to our recommendations
- deliverable: how to use a provenance pattern

- Packaging of provenance patterns


# Engagement

new name for storage WG: storage service definitions WG - already engaged re: vocabulary development
new samples interest group has promised to implement our recommendations
Shared provenance
    - fils, shepherd, nick: cross-institutional testing re: pingback validation
    - exploring trust issues

give a triage structure: now already, next, future possible


# Deliverables

- best practice context document
  - What is a provenance pattern
  - what does it mean to recognize and implement one?
  - usage vs. graph pattern
  - what does a solution look like?
  - How do you know you've done something good?
    - how is it better than other approaches?
  - simplified explanation using terms like "template" and "best practice"
      - a template for citation derived from provenance
      - but the real pattern as a mapping or architectural solution: implication for data integration

(recall: drupal serialization from our database)


# Other ideas
 - Provenance templates (W3work)
 - class-based citation templates
 - attribution flow (paolo's work applied to TDWG scenario)
 - When to map, when to duplicate, semantic redundancy with respect to PROV, et al.
   - possible future pattern. Need opportunities for testing
   - this is a research problem

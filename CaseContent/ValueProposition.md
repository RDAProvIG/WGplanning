# Value Proposition

Effective provenance management is sought by many members of the RDA and wider science data community. We propose a working group to help those members adopt existing provenance management practice. This help will be in the form of documenting provenance use cases: centralising a list of them and generalising them to reveal common ones; documenting existing technical and business processes for provenance management, assisting organisations with sharing provenance and listing existing sources of real provenance information.

We propose a working group on *provenance solution patterns.*

- The patterns should relate to core RDA interests, perhaps data/data
  and data/people relationships.
- Provenance vocabularies offer a level of generality/specificity that address
  what we perceive to be implementation gaps.
- Our goal: constructive engagement with and response to published RDA recommendations.


### WG activity points

1. **Common provenance Use Cases**
    -   Use Cases for provenance data or systems are often articulated in terms
        understood by a particular community however in our group's experience, 
        many provenance Use Cases are differently worded instances of general
        Cases.
    -   The establishment of a published set of UCs would allow people to 
        compare their UCs with known UCs for which recommended implementations
        and other patterns may already be known. It will also allow people to 
        consider provenance UCs posed by others that may be of future iterest 
        to them.

2.  **Provenance patterns**
    -   Some ways of doing things in provenance are better than others. This
        activity is to generate provenance design patterns (for any
        provenance task such as representation, transmission, use etc.)
        perhaps in response to a series of provenance use cases that we
        would generate.
    -   The patterns should relate to core
        RDA interests, perhaps data/data and data/people
        relationships.

3.  **Sharing provenance**
    -   This may only be a single class of
        provenance Use Cases but it is one that is less maturely
        answered by the provenance research community than, say,
        provenance representation. This activity might be to generate
        requirements for the research community to answer or perhaps
        find that no more research is needed for sensible
        recommendations for provenance sharing.

4.  **Strategies for enterprise provenance management**
    -   Some provenance use cases apply
        to whole organisations (or consortia) and some organisations
        (or consortia) may already have experience in implementing
        solutions to them. This activity will list such Use Cases and
        seek descriptions of implemented or proposed solutions from
        members.

5.  **Tools for provenance**
    -   In addition to several well-known provenance conceptual models,
        there are tools to assist with the management of provenance. We
        will list those tools with comparisons in relation to RDA
        interests (perhaps taken from IG and other WG members).
    -   We will also seek to establish a mechanism to keep these tool 
        lists up-to-date beyond the life of the WG.

6. **Provenance data collections**
    -   The provenance research community is knows that the provenance
        ontologies and tools are used but are only anecdotally aware of 
        many current provenance datasets. In order to know the state of 
        operational system's adoption of provenance models and in order 
        to provide access to public provenance data for both 
        education and actual use, we will list as many current provenance 
        data stores as we can find owned by RDA members and others.
    -   We will also seek to establish a mechanism to keep this listing 
        up-to-date beyond the life of the WG.

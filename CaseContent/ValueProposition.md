# Value Proposition

Effective provenance management is sought by many members of the RDA and wider science data community. We propose a working group to help those members adopt existing provenance management practice. This help will be in the form of documenting provenance use cases: centralising a list of them and generalising them to reveal common features and structure.

We propose a working group on *provenance patterns*.

- The patterns should relate to core RDA interests, perhaps data/data
  and data/people relationships.
- Provenance vocabularies offer a level of generality/specificity that address
  what we perceive to be implementation gaps.
- Our goal: alerting the RDA community to similarities and common
  features across use cases in different working groups and interest
  groups.

### WG activity points

1. **Common provenance Use Cases**
    -   Use Cases for provenance data or systems are often articulated in terms
        understood by a particular community however in our group's experience, 
        many provenance Use Cases are differently worded instances of general
        Cases.
    -   The establishment of a published set of UCs would allow people to 
        compare their UCs with known UCs for which recommended implementations
        and other patterns may already be known. It will also allow people to 
        consider provenance UCs posed by others that may be of future interest 
        to them.

2.  **Provenance design patterns**
    -   Some ways of doing things in provenance are better than others. This
        activity is to generate provenance design patterns (for any
        provenance task such as representation, transmission, use etc.)
        perhaps in response to a series of provenance use cases that we
        would generate.
    -   The patterns should relate to core
        RDA interests, perhaps data/data and data/people
        relationships.

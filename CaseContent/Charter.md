# Charter

> WG Charter: A concise articulation of what issues the WG will
>   address within a 12-18 month time frame and what its “deliverables”
>   or outcomes will be.

## Overview

[^1]: First line mostly from the IG Charter  

Tracking provenance for research data is vital to science and scholarship, providing answers to common questions researchers and institutions pose when sharing and exchanging data[^1]:.

The tasks for this Working Group focus on finding, detailing and recommending best practices for provenance representation and management.  

This group will conduct its work in the manner of a business analysis task: identifying business needs and determining solutions to business problems. Since RDA WGs are not themselves research groups (rather groups of researchers and research agencies), this group will look for existing practice and re-present that for use rather than generate new practice.

[^2]: From our P8 slides, with the UC addition

The six activity areas[^2]: of the Working Group will be:

1. Common provenance Use Cases
2. Provenance patterns
3. Sharing provenance
4. Strategies for enterprise provenance management
5. Tools for provenance
6. Provenance data collections

## Deliverables

The deliverables for this Working Group are separated into four time-based cohorts as below. Short-term goals are mostly about seeking existing practice. Medium-term about determining possible output forms for the activity areas. Long-term about delivering those outputs and After-term about ensuring continuation of output custodianship, where required. 

### Short-term (M6)

1. Implement a provenance Use Case recording system 
2. Seek Provenance Use Cases from other IGs/WGs
3. Seek existing patterns and posit initial generalised provenance patterns
4. Seek existing provenance sharing implementations
5. Seek existing enterprise provenance management implementations
6. Seek listings of provenance tools from RDA members and the provenance research community
7. Seek existing collections of open and non-open provenance data

### Medium-term (M12)

8. De-duplicate and categorise provenance Use Cases
9. Determine possible Use Case list outputs
10. Review patterns and determine recommendations or other outputs
11. Review sharing implementations and determine recommendations or other outputs
12. Review enterprise management implementations and seek input on potential WG outputs (recommendations,recipes, etc.)
13. Review provenance tool lists and seek potential WG outputs (a consolidated list, tol descriptors, community list custodianship)
14. Review existing provenance data collections and determine how to present them to the community

### Long-term (M18)

15. Deliver Use Case list outputs
16. Deliver pattern outputs
17. Deliver sharing implementation outputs
18. Deliver enterprise management outputs
19. Deliver tool list outputs
20. Seek provenance tool list custodians
21. Deliver data collection list outputs

### After-term (M18+)

22. Hand over provenance tool and data collection listings governance to non-WG custodians

# Charter

> WG Charter: A concise articulation of what issues the WG will
>   address within a 12-18 month time frame and what its “deliverables”
>   or outcomes will be.

## Overview

[comment]: # First line mostly from the IG Charter  

Tracking provenance for research data is vital to science and scholarship, providing answers to common questions researchers and institutions pose when sharing and exchanging data.

This group focuses on finding, detailing and recommending best practices for provenance representation and some forms of management. 

[comment]: # From our P8 slides, with the UC addition

The five activity areas of the Working Group will be:

1. Common provenance Use Cases
2. Provenance patterns
3. Sharing provenance
4. Strategies for enterprise provenance management
5. Tools for provenance

## Deliverables

The deliverables for this Working Group are separated into four time-based cohorts as below. Short-term goals are mostly about seeking existing practice. Medium-term about determining possible output forms for the activity areas. Long-term about delivering those outputs and After-term about ensuring continuation of output custodianship, where required. 

### Short-term (M6)

1. Implement a provenance Use Case recording system 
2. Seek Provenance Use Cases from other IGs/WGs
3. Seek existing patterns and posit initial generalised provenance patterns
4. Seek existing provenance sharing implementations
5. Seek existing enterprise provenance management implementations
6. Seek listings of provenance tool lists from RDA members and the provenance research community

### Medium-term (M12)

5. De-duplicate and categorise provenance Use Cases
6. Determine possible Use Case list outputs
7. Review patterns and determine recommendations or other outputs
8. Review sharing implementations and determine recommendations or other outputs
9. Review enterprise management implementations and seek input on potential WG outputs (recommendations,recipes, etc.)
10. Review provenance tool lists and seek potential WG outputs (a consolidated list, tol descriptors, community list custodianship)

### Long-term (M18)

11. Deliver Use Case list outputs
12. Deliver pattern outputs
13. Deliver sharing implementation outputs
14. Deliver enterprise management outputs
15. Deliver tool list outputs
16. Seek provenance tool list custodians

### After-term (M18+)

17. Hand over provenance tool listing governance to non-WG custodians

# Charter

## Overview

Tracking provenance for research data is vital to science and scholarship, providing answers to common questions researchers and institutions pose when sharing and exchanging data.

The tasks for this Working Group focus on finding, detailing and recommending best practices for provenance representation and management.  

This group will conduct its work in the manner of a business analysis task: identifying business needs and determining solutions to business problems. Since RDA WGs are not themselves research groups (rather groups of researchers and research agencies), this group will look for existing practice and re-present that for use rather than generate new practice.

The two activity areas of the Working Group will be:

1. Common provenance Use Cases
2. Provenance design patterns

## Deliverables

The deliverables for this Working Group are separated into two time-based cohorts as below. Medium-term goals are mostly about seeking existing practice, and determining possible output forms for the activity areas. Long-term goals are about framing and delivering those outputs.

### Medium-term (M12)

1. A provenance use case recording system[^db]. 
2. An initial collection of provenance use cases, elicited from other interest groups and working groups[^uc].
3. First documented provenance design patterns generalised from use cases[^dp].

### Long-term (M18)

4. A taxonomy for provenance use cases.
5. Recommendations for aligning new use cases with provenance design patterns.
6. A sustainability plan for ongoing data and document custodianship.

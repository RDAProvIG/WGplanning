# Charter

## Overview

Tracking provenance for research data is vital to science and scholarship, providing answers to common questions researchers and institutions pose when sharing and exchanging data.

The tasks for this Working Group focus on finding, detailing and recommending best practices for provenance representation and management.  

This group will conduct its work in the manner of a business analysis task: identifying business needs and determining solutions to business problems. Since RDA WGs are not themselves research groups (rather groups of researchers and research agencies), this group will look for existing practice and re-present that for use rather than generate new practice.

The six activity areas of the Working Group will be:

1. Common provenance Use Cases
2. Provenance patterns
3. Sharing provenance
4. Strategies for enterprise provenance management
5. Tools for provenance
6. Provenance data collections

## Deliverables

The deliverables for this Working Group are separated into three time-based cohorts as below. Short-term goals are mostly about seeking existing practice. Medium-term about determining possible output forms for the activity areas. Long-term about delivering those outputs and After-term about ensuring continuation of output custodianship, where required. 

### Medium-term (M12)

1. A provenance use case recording system.
2. An initial collection of provenance use cases, elicited from other interest groups and working groups.
3. First documented provenance patterns generalised from use cases.
4. A report on investigation of provenance sharing implementations.
5. A review of existing enterprise provenance management implementations.
6. A listings of provenance tools compiled from interviews with RDA members and the provenance research community.
7. A directory of open and non-open provenance data collections.

### Long-term (M18)

8. A taxonomy for provenance use cases.
9. Recommendations for aligning new use cases with provenance patterns.
10. Lessons for provenance sharing and enterprise management implementations.
11. A synthesis and critical comparison of community recommendations for provenance tool custodianship.
12. A summary of best practice principles for provenance data collection stewardship.

### After-term (M18+)

22. A sustainability plan for ongoing tool and data collection custodianship.

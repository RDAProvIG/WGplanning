# Engagement

In addition to serving the RDA community directly, this Working Group aims to serve the immediate interests of existing RDA groups. The reason for this is that provenance is foundational to many other RDA groups' activity and thus maximal impact on the RDA community can be achieved by aligning and assisting work in existing groups. This means this WG will engage heavily with other groups and source its primary requirements and exemplars from other groups:

-   **Publishing Data Workflows WG**
    -   **About:** "Workflows that enable persistence, quality control
        and access are all crucial to enhance the possibilities for
        greater discoverability as well as efficient and reliable reuse
        of research data." **and** "The objectives of this Working
        Group are to provide an analysis of a representative range of
        existing and emerging workflows and standards for data
        publishing, including deposit and citation, and provide
        reference models and implementations for application in new
        workflows."
    -   **Intersections:**
        -   Workflows that enable persistence may need a representation
            of the work done.
        -   Discovery of workflow products.
        -   Data reuse (as per Prov for Reuse Fitness Assessment).
        -   Standards for data publishing ... and citation.

### Other Groups

-   **Dynamic Data Citation WG**
    -   Describing the conceptual model
        containing object relevant to dynamic data citation.

-   **PID Information Types**
    -   **About**: Harmonizing the basic
        information types associated with persistent identifiers.
    -   **Intersections**:
        -   Flesh out Use Case "A.10 Provenance tracing."
-   **Reproducibility IG**
    -   **About**: Advance and enable
        reproducibility in research based on or producing datasets.
    -   **Intersections**: Their conception
        of provenance.
-   **PID IG**
    -   **About**: PIDs
    -   **Intersection**: Requirements for PIDs to
        maintain provenance content (help from them).


### Other Groups

-   **Archives and Records Professionals for Research Data IG**
    -   **About**: Explore the areas where the principles
        and practices in the information disciplines of archives,
        records management, and research data curation overlap and where
        they diverge (proposed IG).
    -   **Intersections**: Need for semantic understanding of archived
        material.
-   **Data Discovery IG**
    -   **About**: Findable, Accessible, Interpretable and Reusable?
    -   **Intersections**: Conceptual model (upper ontology) relating
        elements relevant to data discovery.
-   **Preservation e-Infrastructure IG**
    -   **About**: ...to help repositories to preserve their data
        holdings...
    -   **Intersections**: Semantic content of preserved data holdings.

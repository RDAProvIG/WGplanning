# Engagement

In addition to serving the RDA community directly, this Working Group
aims to serve the immediate interests of existing RDA
groups. Provenance is foundational to many other RDA groups' activity
and thus maximal impact on the RDA community can be achieved by
aligning and assisting work in existing groups. Therefore this working
group will engage heavily with other groups and source its primary
requirements and exemplars from other groups. Examples of
intersections we believe will be productive include the following:

Publishing Data Workflows WG:

: Interest in workflow persistence and quality control, data deposit
  and citation, reference models and implementation.

Dynamic Data Citation WG:

: Interest in a conceptual model for citation fidelity despite changes
  over time.

PID Information Types:

:  The Use Case "A.10 Provenance tracing."

Reproducibility IG:

:  The role of provenance models in support of replication.

PID IG:

:  Requirements for PIDs to maintain provenance content.

Archives and Records Professionals for Research Data IG:

:  Need for semantic understanding of archived material.

Data Discovery IG:

:  Upper ontology elements relevant to data discovery.

Preservation e-Infrastructure IG:

:  Semantic content of preserved data holdings.

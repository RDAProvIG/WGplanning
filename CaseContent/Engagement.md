# Engagement

In addition to serving the RDA community directly, this Working Group
aims to serve the immediate interests of existing RDA
groups. Provenance is foundational to many other RDA groups' activity
and thus maximal impact on the RDA community can be achieved by
aligning and assisting work in existing groups. Therefore this working
group will engage heavily with other groups and source its primary
requirements and exemplars from other groups. RDA Groups with whom we
have already communicated are listed in the **Adoption** section. Examples of
intersections we believe will be productive over the next ten months
include the following:

Reproducibility IG:

:  The role of provenance models in support of replication.

PID IG:

:  Requirements for PIDs to maintain provenance content.

Archives and Records Professionals for Research Data IG:

:  Need for semantic understanding of archived material.

Data Discovery IG:

:  Upper ontology elements relevant to data discovery.

Preservation e-Infrastructure IG:

:  Semantic content of preserved data holdings.


Although the following groups are either at or near completion of their work, we
see opportunities to respond to portions of their deliverables with our own.

- Publishing Data Workflows WG

- Data Citation WG

- PID Kernel Information WG

## From our P8 Slides

-   **Publishing Data Workflows WG**
    -   **About:** "Workflows that enable persistence, quality control
        and access are all crucial to enhance the possibilities for
        greater discoverability as well as efficient and reliable reuse
        of research data." **and** "The objectives of this Working
        Group are to provide an analysis of a representative range of
        existing and emerging workflows and standards for data
        publishing, including deposit and citation, and provide
        reference models and implementations for application in new
        workflows."
    -   **Intersections:**
        -   Workflows that enable persistence may need a representation
            of the work done.
        -   Discovery of workflow products.
        -   Data reuse (as per Prov for Reuse Fitness Assessment [^1]).
        -   Standards for data publishing ... and citation.

### Other Groups

-   **Dynamic Data Citation WG**
    -   Describing the conceptual model
        containing object relevant to dynamic data citation.

-   **PID Information Types**
    -   **About**: Harmonizing the basic
        information types associated with persistent identifiers.
    -   **Intersections**:
        -   Flesh out Use Case "A.10 Provenance tracing."
-   **Reproducibility IG**
    -   **About**: Advance and enable
        reproducibility in research based on or producing datasets.
    -   **Intersections**: Their conception
        of provenance.
-   **PID IG**
    -   **About**: PIDs
    -   **Intersection**: Requirements for PIDs to
        maintain provenance content (help from them).


### Other Groups

-   **Archives and Records Professionals for Research Data IG**
    -   **About**: Explore the areas where the principles
        and practices in the information disciplines of archives,
        records management, and research data curation overlap and where
        they diverge (proposed IG).
    -   **Intersections**: Need for semantic understanding of archived
        material.
-   **Data Discovery IG**
    -   **About**: Findable, Accessible, Interpretable and Reusable?
    -   **Intersections**: Conceptual model (upper ontology) relating
        elements relevant to data discovery.
-   **Preservation e-Infrastructure IG**
    -   **About**: ...to help repositories to preserve their data
        holdings...
    -   **Intersections**: Semantic content of preserved data holdings.

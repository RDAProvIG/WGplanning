# Adoption

## Other RDA groups
This WG proposal is engagement-driven, primarily with other RDA groups, thus it is in them that we expect to see 
initial adoption.
   
Where another RDA group presents us with a provenance use case, we hope to either:

* associate that use case with a generic use case and a thus a pre-made generic resolution
* provide a direct provenance pattern-based resolution directly

In either case, we hope to promote a pattern that the RDA group will adopt and promote to its members.


## Prov WG member institutions
Most current RDA Provenance IG members are likely to become Prov WG members for their interest in provenance is 
adoption and that too is the WG's goal. It is likely that outputs from this group, having been generated by its members 
in response to their direct needs and similar needs of other RDA groups, will therefore be fed back into their home
institutions for adoption there.

## Non-RDA groups
The international provenance research community is in contact with many potential consumers of provenance patterns due 
to their profile as experts on provenance. The potential consumers don't always receive the advice they are seeking due
to differences in their aims and that of the research community's. The research community needs to push the provenance
envelope forward and not dwell on previous work, even when that work may contain patterns perfectly suited to the 
potential consumers' needs.

The Provenance IG has and the WG will have, if membership proceeds as expected, good contacts with the international 
provenance research community with several IG members having made substantial contributions to provenance research 
initiatives such as the [Open Provenance Model](http://openprovenance.org/), 
[ProvONE](http://vcvcomputing.com/provone/provone.html), the [PROV W3C standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-overview/) 
and having presented at many recent provenance conferences such as [IPAW 2014](http://www.ipaw.info/ipaw14) & 
[2016](http://www.ipaw.info/ipaw16), [TaPP 2015](http://workshops.inf.ed.ac.uk/tapp2015/), 
[TaPP 2017](http://batesa.web.engr.illinois.edu/tapp17/).

The full listing of the IG's involvement in provenance conferences is available on the RDA Prov IG wiki:

## Continued adoption
Some of the outputs from this WG are targeted at continued adoption over time. This proposal includes a deliverable for
a "sustainability plan for ongoing data and  document custodianship" after having initially established a 
database of use cases and provenance patterns. Such a plan is currently missing 
from the international provenance community despite widespread recognition that it would be useful. This was recognised
at IPAW 2016 independently of any RDA involvement. 

It is expected that at the conclusion of this WG, the current
provenance IG will have some role in the custodianship of its outputs.

# Summary

We plan to propose a working group on provenance solution patterns.

- Provenance vocabularies offer a level of generality/specificity that address
  what we perceive to be implementation gaps.
- Our goal: constructive engagement with and response to published RDA recommendations.

# Proposed timeline

- **Now**: Kickoff at RDA Plenary 8.
- **October 2016**: Establish web presence and mailing list, hold
  initial virtual meeting, prioritize deliverables, distribute workload.
- **December 2016**: Identify initial set of focus areas and discuss.
- **February 2017**: Draft case statements distributed.
- **April 2017**: Discuss draft case statements and formation of WGs at Plenary 9.
- **May 2017**: Finalize and circulate case statements for WGs.
- **May--September 2017**: Initial Working Group activity.
- **September 2017**: Meeting WGs and summary of activity at Plenary 10.

# Initial WG activity points

1.  **Provenance patterns**
    -   Some ways of doing things in provenance are better than others. This
        activity is to generate provenance design patterns (for any
        provenance task such as representation, transmission, use etc.)
        perhaps in response to a series of provenance use cases that we
        would generate.
    -   The patterns should relate to core
        RDA interests, perhaps data/data and data/people
        relationships.

2.  **Sharing provenance**
    -   This may only be a single class of
        provenance use cases but it is one that is less maturely
        answered by the provenance research community than, say,
        provenance representation. This activity might be to generate
        requirements for the research community to answer or perhaps
        find that no more research is needed for sensible
        recommendations for provenance sharing.

# Activity points

3.  **Strategies for implementation**
    -   Some provenance use cases apply
        to whole organisations (or consortia) and some organisations
        (or consortia) may already have experience in implementing
        solutions to them. This activity will list such use cases and
        seek descriptions of implemented or proposed solutions from
        members.

4.  **Tools for provenance**
    -   In addition to several well-known provenance conceptual models,
        there are tools to assist with the management of provenance. We
        will list those tools with comparisons in relation to RDA
        interests (perhaps taken from IG and other WG members).

# Other groups with which we likely have links

-   **Publishing Data Workflows WG**
    -   **About:** "Workflows that enable persistence, quality control
        and access are all crucial to enhance the possibilities for
        greater discoverability as well as efficient and reliable reuse
        of research data." **and** "The objectives of this Working
        Group are to provide an analysis of a representative range of
        existing and emerging workflows and standards for data
        publishing, including deposit and citation, and provide
        reference models and implementations for application in new
        workflows."
    -   **Intersections:**
        -   Workflows that enable persistence may need a representation
            of the work done.
        -   Discovery of workflow products.
        -   Data reuse (as per Prov for Reuse Fitness Assessment [^1]).
        -   Standards for data publishing ... and citation.

# Other Groups

-   **Dynamic Data Citation WG**
    -   Describing the conceptual model
        containing object relevant to dynamic data citation.

-   **PID Information Types**
    -   **About**: Harmonizing the basic
        information types associated with persistent identifiers.
    -   **Intersections**:
        -   Flesh out Use Case "A.10 Provenance tracing."
-   **Reproducibility IG**
    -   **About**: Advance and enable
        reproducibility in research based on or producing datasets.
    -   **Intersections**: Their conception
        of provenance.
-   **PID IG**
    -   **About**: PIDs
    -   **Intersection**: Requirements for PIDs to
        maintain provenance content (help from them).


# Other Groups

-   **Archives and Records Professionals for Research Data IG**
    -   **About**: Explore the areas where the principles
        and practices in the information disciplines of archives,
        records management, and research data curation overlap and where
        they diverge (proposed IG).
    -   **Intersections**: Need for semantic understanding of archived
        material.
-   **Data Discovery IG**
    -   **About**: Findable, Accessible, Interpretable and Reusable?
    -   **Intersections**: Conceptual model (upper ontology) relating
        elements relevant to data discovery.
-   **Preservation e-Infrastructure IG**
    -   **About**: ...to help repositories to preserve their data
        holdings...
    -   **Intersections**: Semantic content of preserved data holdings.
